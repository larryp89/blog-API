1. Project Scope
   Objective: Create a backend API with two different front-ends (one for blog consumption and one for blog management).
   Features:

   - Blog posts and comments
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Separate front-ends for readers and authors

2. Project Structure
   Monorepo: One GitHub repository with separate directories for the backend and each front-end.

3. Data Models and Schemas

Blog Posts:

- Fields: title, content, authorId, createdAt, updatedAt, published

Comments:

- Fields: postId, userId, comment, createdAt

Users:

- Fields: username, email, password, role (author/reader)

4. Set Up the Backend
   Create Express App:

   - Initialize the project and install dependencies:

     - express, prisma, jsonwebtoken, passport, bcrypt, etc.

   - Define Models in Prisma:
     - Create prisma/schema.prisma with your data models.

   Set Up Routes and Controllers:

   - Organize routes RESTfully for posts and comments.
   - Create controllers for handling CRUD operations.

5. Implement Authentication
   JWTs for Authentication:

   - Use jsonwebtoken to create and verify JWTs.
   - Protect routes that require authentication.
   - Passport for Authentication Strategy (Optional):
   - Use Passportâ€™s JWT strategy to manage authentication.

6. Test Your API

   - Use Postman to test your API endpoints.

7. Develop the Front-Ends (React)
   Reader Front-End:

   - Fetch and display posts and comments.
   - Allow users to add comments.

   Author Front-End:

   - Manage posts (create, edit, delete, publish/unpublish).
   - Manage comments (delete or edit).

8. Manage State and Authentication on Front-End
   Store JWTs:

   - Use localStorage for storing JWTs.
   - Attach JWTs to API requests via Authorization headers.

9. Implement Additional Features
   Rich Text Editor:

Integrate tools like TinyMCE for authoring posts.

Comments Management:

Allow authors to manage comments on their posts.

10. Deploy the Applications
    Deployment:

    - Deploy your API using a PaaS like Heroku, Vercel, or similar.
